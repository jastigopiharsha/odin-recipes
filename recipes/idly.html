    <h3>description</h3>
    <p>Idli or idly (/ˈɪdliː/; plural: idlis) is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented de-husked black lentils and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.
    <p> Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.</p>
